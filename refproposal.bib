abstract ={A frequency-domain parametric study using generalized consistent transmitting boundaries has been performed to evaluate the significance of topographic effects on the seismic response of steep slopes. The results show that the peak amplification of motion at the crest of a slope occurs at a normalized frequency H/λ = 0.2, where H is the slope height and λ is the wavelength of the motion. The importance of the natural site frequency is illustrated by the analysis of a stepped layer over a half-space. It was found that the natural frequency of the region behind the crest can dominate the response, relative to the topographic effect, for the conditions studied. Moreover, the effect of topography can be handled separately from the amplification due to the natural frequency of the deposit behind the crest of the slope. This concept of separating the amplification caused by topography from that caused by the natural frequency is advantageous to the development of a simplified method to estimate topographic effects.},

  abstract={In the Ms 5.9 Athens, Greece, earthquake, surprisingly heavy damage occurred on the eastern bank of the Kifissos River canyon. To explore whether the particular topographic relief and/or the local soil conditions have contributed to the observed concentration and non-uniform damage distribution within a 300-m zone from the canyon crest, we conduct finite- element analyses in one and two dimensions, using Ricker wavelets and six realistic accelerograms as excitation. The nonlinear soil response is simulated in the time-domain using a hyperbolic stress-strain model, and also approximated using a modified equivalent-linear algorithm; results obtained by means of the two methods are discussed in detail. Our simulations show that topographic effects are substantial only within about 50 m from the canyon ridge, materializing primarily because of the presence of relatively soft soil layers near the surface of the profile. We then introduce the concept of two- dimensional/one-dimensional response spectral ratio to describe the effects of topography as a function of local soil conditions, and suggest a frequency- and location-dependent topographic aggravation factor to be introduced for the modification of design spectra in a seismic code.},

  abstract={During the 1999 Athens earthquake, the town of Ada`mes, located on the eastern side of the Kifissos river canyon, experienced unexpectedly heavy dam- age. Despite the particular geometry of the slope that caused significant motion am- plification, topography effects alone cannot explain the uneven damage distribution within a 300-m zone parallel to the canyon’s crest, which is characterized by a rather uniform structural quality. In this article, we illustrate the important role of soil stratigraphy and material heterogeneity on the topographic aggravation of surface ground motion. For this purpose, we first conduct an extensive time-domain para- metric study using idealized stratified profiles and Gaussian stochastic fields to char- acterize the spatial distribution of soil properties, and using Ricker wavelets to de- scribe the seismic input motion; the results show that both topography and local soil conditions significantly affect the spatial variability of seismic motion. We next per- form elastic two-dimensional wave propagation analyses based on available local geotechnical and seismological data and validate our results by comparison with aftershock recordings.},

abstract ="Unusually severe structural damage was reported during the 2010 M 7.0 Haiti earthquake in the vicinity of Hotel Montana, located on top of a ridge in the district of Pétionville. Prompted by the observations, U.S. Geological Survey seismic stations were deployed, and aftershock recordings indicated ground‐motion amplification on the top of the hill compared to adjacent stations on reference site conditions. The presence of topographic relief has been shown to significantly aggravate the consequences of strong ground motion during past events, and topographic effects were brought forward to explain the observations. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of topographic amplification as the dominant factor that contributed to the damage concentration in the vicinity of Hotel Montana. We initially conduct numerical simulations of the ridge seismic response assuming elastic homogeneous site conditions, and show that numerical predictions of topographic amplification disagree with the field data both in amplitude and in frequency. Conversely, while 1D ground‐response analyses for the site conditions at the hilltop predict amplification in the same frequency range as the field data, they significantly underestimate the recorded amplitude. We then conduct numerical simulations of the foothill ridge response to seismic motion while accounting for soil layering, and qualitatively demonstrate that the recorded amplification is most likely attributed to coupled site–topographic amplification effects, namely to seismic waves trapped in the soft soil layers of the near surface, amplified as a consequence of reverberations, and further modified due to diffraction and scattering upon incidence on the irregular ground surface. Parametric investigations of the topography–soil amplification coupling effects are then conducted, and our results show that when accounting for a hypothetical soil–bedrock interface at 100 m depth, predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed motion.",

abstract = "This is a review of the current state of the art in characterizing effects of local geology on ground motion. A new horizon is clear in this aspect of strong motion studies. Non-linear amplification at sediment sites appears to be more pervasive than seismologists used to think. Several recent observations about the weak motion and the strong motion suggest that the non-linear amplification at sediment sites may be very common. First, on average, the amplification is always greater at the younger sediment sites for all frequencies up to 12 Hz, in the case of weak motion; while the relation is reversed for frequencies higher than 5 Hz, in the case of strong motion. Secondly, the application of the amplification factor determined from weak motion overestimates significantly the strong motion at sediment sites observed during the Loma Prieta earthquake within the epicentral distance of about 50 km. Thirdly, the variance of peak ground acceleration around the mean curve decreases with the increasing earthquake magnitude. Finally, the above non-linear effects are expected from geotechnical studies both in the magnitude of departure from the linear prediction and in the threshold acceleration level beyond which the non-linearity begins.

title = {Effects of surface topography on ground shaking prediction: implications for seismic hazard analysis and recommendations for seismic design},
year = {2014}, 
doi = {10.1093/gji/ggu095}, 
abstract ={This study examines the role of topographic effects on the prediction of earthquake ground motion. Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are mathematical models that estimate the shaking level induced by an earthquake as a function of several parameters, such as magnitude, source-to-site distance, style of faulting and ground type. However, little importance is given to the effects of topography, which, as known, may play a significant role on the level, duration and frequency content of ground motion. Ridges and crests are often lost inside the large number of sites considered in the definition of a GMPE. Hence, it is presumable that current GMPEs are unable to accurately predict the shaking level at the top of a relief. The present work, which follows the article of Massa et al. about topographic effects, aims at overcoming this limitation by amending an existing GMPE with an additional term to account for the effects of surface topography at a specific site. First, experimental ground motion values and ground motions predicted by the attenuation model of Bindi et al. for five case studies are compared and contrasted in order to quantify their discrepancy and to identify anomalous behaviours of the sites investigated. Secondly, for the site of Narni (Central Italy), amplification factors derived from experimental measurements and numerical analyses are compared and contrasted, pointing out their impact on probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and design norms. In particular, with reference to the Italian building code, our results have highlighted the inadequacy of the national provisions concerning the definition of the seismic load at top of ridges and crests, evidencing a significant underestimation of ground motion around the site resonance frequency.},

	complex geological structures such as sedimentary basins and ridges
	that are some distance away from the earthquake source. We overcome
	the problem of multiple physical scales by subdividing the original
	problem into two simpler ones. The first is an auxiliary problem
	that simulates the earthquake source and propagation path effects
	with a model that encompasses the source and a background structure
	from which the localized feature has been removed. The second problem
	models local site effects. Its input is a set of equivalent localized
	forces derived from the first step. These forces act only within
	a single layer of elements adjacent to the interface between the
	exterior region and the geological feature of interest. This enables
	us to reduce the domain size in the second step. If the background
	subsurface structure is simple, one can replace the finite-element
	method in the first step with an alternative efficient method. The
	methodology is illustrated in a companion paper (Yoshimura et al.,
	2003) for several 3D problems of increasing physical and computational
	complexity. We consider first a flat-layered, stratigraphic system.
	For this simple case, the first step can be carried out by means
	of 3D Green's function evaluations. The extension to more general
	problems is illustrated by two examples: a basin and a hill, with
	the same background stratigraphy. To verify the two-step procedure
	with a problem for which the finite-element method is used throughout,
	we model ground motion in a small region of the Los Angeles Basin,
	using both the two-step domain-reduction method and the traditional

year = {1996}, 
abstract ={The Northridge, California, earthquake that strongly shook the city of Los Angeles in January 1994, produced one of the highest ground accelerations ever recorded in an earthquake, at a site located on top of a small hill in Tarzana, about 6 km south of the epicenter. The subsequent study of aftershock recordings obtained by a dense seismic array deployed on the hill a few days after the earthquake showed the existence of a strong amplification at stations located at the top of the hill, relative to stations near the base (Spudich et al., 1996). Resonances and polarization rotations were also observed. We investigate in this study the role that the topography of the site played on the observed ground motions and accelerations. To this aim, we perform numerical simulations and study the response of the three-dimensional topography of the site to incident shear waves polarized in different directions. The method used is a boundary integral equation scheme in which the Green's functions are calculated by the discrete wavenumber method. The results obtained show that the topography of the site, though quite gentle (the hill is less than 20-m high), strongly affects the ground motions in the frequency range between 2 and 15 Hz. Many of the observed characteristics of the seismic response at Tarzana are explained in part by its topography: the consistent amplification of ground motion at and near the top of the hill, the directional seismic response of the hill that results in a strong amplification of the ground motion transverse to the direction of elongation of the hill, the existence of a fundamental transverse oscillatory resonance mode of the hill at 3 to 5 Hz, the rotation of the polarization of ground motion, and the spatial variation of amplification over the hill at the fundamental resonance mode. The seismic response of the topography, however, does not fully explain the amplitude of the effects observed. The three-dimensional geological structure of the site must in some way amplify the effect of the topography to produce the observed seismic response. In spite of not being as strong as the observed effect, the topographic effect of the site is considerable. The ground motion is amplified by factors ranging from 30\% to 100\% at some locations in the frequency range from 2 to 15 Hz. Rapid spatial variations of ground-shaking intensities can take place over distance scales of a few tens of meters at high frequency. Finally, the results of the simulation indicate that the topography of the site amplified the large east-west accelerations recorded there during the Northridge mainshock by 30\% to 40\%.},

  abstract={The kinematic response of a bedrock-dominated mountain edifice to seismic shaking near Lake Coleridge in the Southern Alps of New Zealand was examined. A small, elongated, and bedrock-dominated mountain ridge (Little Red Hill) was equipped with a seismic array. Seven EARSS instruments (Mark L-4-3D seismometers) were installed along the ridge crest, the flank, and at the base of the 210 m high, 500 m wide, and 800 m long mountain edifice from February to July 2006. Seismic records of local and regional earthquakes were used to provide information on amplification and deamplification effects, as well as on the frequency response at different parts on the edifice. The ground-motion records were analyzed using three different methods: comparisons of peak ground accelerations, power spectral density analysis, and standard spectral ratio analysis. Time and frequency domain analyses show that site amplification is concentrated along the elongated crest of the edifice where amplifications of up to 1100% were measured relative to the motion at the flat base. The field experiment also highlighted the extreme variations in amplification with regard to closely located sites but at contrasting topographic locations. Theoretical calculations and frequency analyses of field data indicate a maximum response along the ridge crest of Little Red Hill for frequencies of about 5 Hz, which correlate to wavelengths approximately equal to the half-width or height of the edifice. The consequence of amplification effects on the stability and degradation of rock masses can be seen: areas showing high amplification effects overlap with the spatial distribution of seismically generated block fields at Little Red Hill. It is concluded that topography, geometry, and distance to the seismic source play key roles in causing amplification effects of seismic ground motion and supporting dilation and degradation of rock mass across bedrock-dominated mountain edifices.},

abstract ={Field experiments were performed to obtain data needed for studying the effects of topography on seismic motion. L-7 instruments deployed at the crest and base of Kagel Mountain and Josephine Peak, California, recorded several aftershocks of the February 9, 1971, San Fernando earthquake. L-7 instruments deployed at the crest, middle, and base of Butler Mountain near Tonopah, Nevada, recorded the seismic signal generated by the cavity collapse following the Nevada Test Site detonation, ALGODONES. Frequency-dependent amplification of the motion at the crest relative to the motion at the base was observed at all three mountains. Factors as large as 30 in the frequency domain were seen at Kagel Mountain with lesser amounts at the other two locations. The three mountains are similar in shape, but different in size. The effect of shape is not clear. The smallest mountain amplified the motion in a narrow range of periods (peaking around 0.3 to 0.5 sec), the medium-size mountain showed amplification over a slightly broader range (peaking at periods of 0.4 to 0.5 sec), whereas the largest mountain showed less amplification, but it occurred over a broader range of periods. Effects in the time domain are generally comparable to, or less than, the effects in the frequency domain. The ratios of peak amplitudes (crest to base) are usually less than the spectral ratios. It is concluded that topography plays a significant role and is an important consideration in determining the seismic motion that a particular site receives.},

We show that by adopting a non-conforming octree-based meshing approach associated with a virtual representation of the surficial irregularity, we can obtain accurate representations of ground motion. From the computational point of view, our methodology proves to be also efficient, and more importantly, it allows us to preserve the salient features of multi-resolution cubic-shaped finite elements for wave propagation applications. We implemented the non-conforming meshing scheme for the treatment of realistic topographies into Hercules, the octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. We tested the benefits of the strategy by benchmarking its results against reference examples, and by means of numerical error estimate analyses. Our qualitative and quantitative comparisons showed a close agreement between our numerical results and the reference results, and also, that the order of convergence of the displacement field is preserved in the presence of surface topography. Moreover, this performance was obtained by using the same mesh refinement techniques with cubic elements as in traditional flat free-surface simulations. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract ={A brief review of experimental and theoretical results about the effect of topography on seismic motion shows that they are consistent only on a qualitative basis. Amplification at mountain tops for wavelengths comparable with mountain widths is predicted and observed, but the numerical simulations often underestimate the actual observed effects. We propose that this disagreement is because current models are not complex enough.We therefore computed the response to incident SH waves of a set of different complex configurations that include two-dimensional surface topography, with or without periodic ridges and subsurface layering. The results show that: (1) the topographic effect in itself is difficult to isolate from other effects, like surface layering, and therefore the amplification on top of geomorphologically complex sites cannot be predicted by a priori estimations based solely on topography; and (2) the high crest/base amplification ratio observed in the field cannot, usually, be matched even with complex two-dimensional structures with incident plane SH waves, which suggests that more complex models are needed to incorporate more complex wave fields (e.g., SV, surface) and three-dimensional geologic configurations.},

For that purpose we solve and analyze simple scattering problems under P and SV in-plane wave assumptions, using two well known direct boundary-element-based numerical methods. After establishing the difference between scattered and diffracted motions, and introducing the concept of artificious and physically based incoming fields, we obtain the amplitude of the Fourier spectra for the diffracted part of the response: this is achieved after establishing the connection between the spatial distribution of the transfer function over the studied simple topographies and the diffracted field. From the numerical simulations it is observed that this diffracted part of the response is responsible for the amplification of the surface ground motions due to the geometric effect. Furthermore, it is also found that the diffraction field sets in a fingerprint of the topographic effect in the total ground motions. These conclusions are further supported by observations in the time-domain in terms of snapshots of the propagation patterns over the complete computational model. In this sense the geometric singularities are clearly identified as sources of diffraction and for the considered range of dimensionless frequencies it is evident that larger amplifications are obtained for the geometries containing a larger number of diffraction sources thus resulting in a stronger topographic effect. The need for closed-form solutions of canonical problems to construct a robust analysis method based on the diffraction field is identified.},

    abstract={CyberShake, as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center's (SCEC) Community Modeling Environment, is developing a methodology that explicitly incorporates deterministic source and wave propagation effects within seismic hazard calculations through the use of physics-based 3D ground motion simulations. To calculate a waveform-based seismic hazard estimate for a site of interest, we begin with Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2.0 (UCERF2.0) and identify all ruptures within 200 km of the site of interest. We convert the UCERF2.0 rupture definition into multiple rupture variations with differing hypocenter locations and slip distributions, resulting in about 415,000 rupture variations per site. Strain Green Tensors are calculated for the site of interest using the SCEC Community Velocity Model, Version 4 (CVM4), and then, using reciprocity, we calculate synthetic seismograms for each rupture variation. Peak intensity measures are then extracted from these synthetics and combined with the original rupture probabilities to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for the site. Being explicitly site-based, CyberShake directly samples the ground motion variability at that site over many earthquake cycles (i.e., rupture scenarios) and alleviates the need for the ergodic assumption that is implicitly included in traditional empirically based calculations. Thus far, we have simulated ruptures at over 200 sites in the Los Angeles region for ground shaking periods of 2 s and longer, providing the basis for the first generation CyberShake hazard maps. Our results indicate that the combination of rupture directivity and basin response effects can lead to an increase in the hazard level for some sites, relative to that given by a conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we find that the physics-based hazard results are much more sensitive to the assumed magnitude-area relations and magnitude uncertainty estimates used in the definition of the ruptures than is found in the traditional GMPE approach. This reinforces the need for continued development of a better understanding of earthquake source characterization and the constitutive relations that govern the earthquake rupture process.},

abstract ="A field program was conducted during the summer of 1977 in the Appalachian Mountains to study some of the effects of topography on seismic-wave motions. The study areas included Powell Mountain (394 m of relief) in Lee County, Virginia, Bays and River Mountains (260 m of relief) in Sullivan County, Tennessee, and Gap and Brush Mountains (236 m of relief) in Montgomery County, Virginia. The majority of the data were recorded using 1 Hz horizontal seismometers aligned parallel to the long dimension of the northeast trending ridges. Some vertical (1 Hz) data were also collected. The signal sources were quarry and mine blasts located mostly to the west and northwest of the study areas. The Tennessee earthquake of July 27, 1977 [mb (Lg) = 3.5] was recorded at Bays and River Mountains by both horizontal and vertical sensors.The basic data consist of maximum amplitudes and their associated periods measured from the Sg-Lg coda (some Rayleigh-wave and P-wave data were also obtained) at various sites on the ridges and in the valleys. In total, 137 events were considered from which 444 measurements of trace amplitude and wave period were made. These were cast in the form of 382 amplitude ratios between the individual sites. Four of the five ridges (Powell Mountain, Gap Mountain, Bays Mountain, and River Mountain) show amplification at the mountaintops with respect to the valleys. However, one ridge, with a less pronounced crest than the others (Brush Mountain), exhibited some wave-amplitude suppression. The vertical data obtained display a lesser degree of amplification than do the horizontal data as might be expected from other published observations.To reduce the scatter found in the individual amplitude ratios, average amplitude ratios between mountaintop and valley sites were determined. These average ratios showed that the seismic wave amplitudes at the mountaintops were amplified by factors from 1.7 to 3.4. Employing the theory for scattering of SH waves in a half-space with an irregular free surface, the predicted ground motions for each of the study areas were obtained. The comparison of the observed average ratios with these theoretical calculations indicates that a topographic effect is present but inadequately modeled by the theory.",

abstract ={To study the influence of topography on ground motion, eight seismic recorders were deployed for a period of one year over Poverty Ridge on the east side of the San Francisco Bay Area, California. This location is desirable because of its proximity to local earthquake sources and the significant topographic relief of the array (439 m). Topographic amplification is evaluated as a function of frequency using a variety of methods, including reference‐site‐based spectral ratios and single‐station horizontal‐to‐vertical spectral ratios using both shear waves from earthquakes and ambient noise. Field observations are compared with the predicted ground motion from an accurate digital model of the topography and a 3D local velocity model. Amplification factors from the theoretical calculations are consistent with observations. The fundamental resonance of the ridge is prominently observed in the spectra of data and synthetics; however, higher‐frequency peaks are also seen primarily for sources in line with the major axis of the ridge, perhaps indicating higher resonant modes. Excitations of lateral ribs off of the main ridge are also seen at frequencies consistent with their dimensions. The favored directions of resonance are shown to be transverse to the major axes of the topographic features.},

abstract={A compact dyadic diffraction coefficient for electromagnetic waves obliquely incident on a curved edse formed by perfectly conducting curved ot plane surfaces is obtained. This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition regions adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries, where the diffraction coefficients of Keller's original theory fail. Our method is based on Keller's method of the canonical problem, which in this case is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. When the proper ray-fixed coordinate system is introduced, the dyadic diffraction coefficient for the wedge is found to be the sum of only two dyads, and it is shown that this is also true for the dyadic diffraction coefficients of higher order edges. One dyad contains the acoustic soft diffraction coefficient; the other dyad contains the acoustic hard diffraction coefficient. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresenel integrals, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. The diffraction coefficients have the same form for the different types of edge illumination; only the arguments of the Fresnel integrals are different. Since diffraction is a local phenomenon, and locally the curved edge structure is wedge shaped, this result is readily extended to the curved wedge. It is interesting that even though the polarizations and the wavefront curvatures of the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves are markedly different, the total field calculated from this high-frequency solution for the curved wedge is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries.},

abstract ={A scale model experiment was conducted to study the effect of topography on ground motion for incident P waves. It was found that amplifications as large as 35 per cent may occur in the time domain for a wide-band input with predominant wavelength equal to the width of the scatterer base. The largest diffracted wave observed was a forward scattered Rayleigh wave with an amplitude of about 55 per cent of the incident motion. Examination of the spectral ratios showed that, for more band-limited input pulses, peak amplifications of the crest motions relative to the base may be as high as 200 per cent. These differences are comparable to, but smaller than, the 400 per cent amplifications observed in field studies conducted by Davis and West (1973). Results of a parameter study indicate topographic effects to be weakly dependent on slope and angle of incidence. However, the effects do change significantly as a function of frequency and position on the scatterer. For receiver positions at depth, scattered body waves were found to be more significant. The radiation lobes of these waves are directed predominantly downward. Qualitative agreement was found between the model results and field results observed on a nearly two-dimensional feature (NASA Mountain near Beatty, Nevada) where underground nuclear explosion ground motions were recorded.},

abstract = {The two-dimensional scattering and diffraction of plane SH waves by a semi-cylindrical canyon is analysed for a general angle of wave incidence. The closed-form solution of the problem shows that the surface topography can have prominent effects on incident waves only when the wavelengths of incident motion are short compared to the radius of a canyon. The surface amplification of displacement amplitudes around and in the canyon changes rapidly from one point to another, but the amplification is always less than 2. The over-all trends of amplification pattern are determined by two principal parameters: (1) γ, the angle of incidence of plane SH waves, and (2) η, the ratio of radius of the canyon to one-half wave length of incident waves. The higher η leads to greater complexity of the pattern of surface displacement amplitudes characterized by more abrupt changes of amplification from one point to another, while γ mainly determines the over-all trends of displacement amplitudes. For grazing and nearly grazing incidences, for example, a strong shadow zone is developed behind the canyon.The qualitative analysis of the topographic effects on the Pacoima Dam accelerogram,1 based on the semi-cylindrical canyon, suggests that this strong-motion record was not seriously affected by surface topography of the recording site.}

For example, the maximum effect of a site 12 m deep was at 25 Hz while that of a site 85 m deep was at 11 Hz. Most of the observed tunnel effects could be explained in terms of interference between the incident and surface-reflected waves. Rock outcrop sites on hills affected the amplitude of incident signals by as much as a factor of eight, at frequencies inversely proportional to the dimension of the hill, and more for horizontally than for vertically polarized signals. Hard-rock site effects typically varied by no more than a factor of three for input signals from different earthquakes, having widely different azimuth and incident angles.},

abstract ={The scattering induced by surface topographies of arbitrary shapes, submitted to horizontally polarized shear waves (SH) is studied analytically. In particular, we propose an analysis technique based on a representation of the scattered field like the superposition of incident, reflected and diffracted rays. The diffraction contribution is the result of the interaction of the incident and reflected waves, with the geometric singularities present in the surface topography. This splitting of the solution into different terms, makes the difference between our method and alternative numerical/analytical approaches, where the complete field is described by a single term. The contribution from the incident and reflected fields is considered using standard techniques, while the diffracted field is obtained using the idea of a ray as was introduced by the geometrical theory of diffraction. Our final solution however, is an approximation in the sense that, surface-diffracted rays are neglected while we retain the contribution from corner-diffracted rays and its further diffraction. These surface rays are only present when the problem has smooth boundaries combined with shadow zones, which is far from being the typical scenario in far-field earthquake engineering. The proposed technique was tested in the study of a combined hill-canyon topography and the results were compared with those of a boundary element algorithm. After considering only secondary sources of diffraction, a difference of 0.09 per cent (with respect to the incident field amplitude) was observed. The proposed analysis technique can be used in the interpretation of numerical and experimental results and in the preliminary prediction of the response in complex topographies.},

abstract ={Topography influences ground motion and, in general, increases the amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys have reduced ground motions, as is observed from data recorded during and after real earthquakes and from numerical simulations. However, recent publications have focused mainly on the implications for ground motion in the mountainous regions themselves, whereas the impact on surrounding low-lying areas has received less attention. Here, we develop a new spectral-element mesh implementation to accommodate realistic topography as well as the complex shape of the Taipei sedimentary basin, which is located close to the Central Mountain Range in northern Taiwan. Spectral-element numerical simulations indicate that high-resolution topography can change peak ground velocity (PGV) values in mountainous areas by $\pm$50$\%$ compared to a half-space response. We further demonstrate that large-scale topography can affect the propagation of seismic waves in nearby areas. For example, if a shallow earthquake occurs in the I-Lan region of Taiwan, the Central Mountain Range will significantly scatter the surface waves and will in turn reduce the amplitude of ground motion in the Taipei basin. However, as the hypocenter moves deeper, topography scatters body waves, which subsequently propagate as surface waves into the basin. These waves continue to interact with the basin and the surrounding mountains, finally resulting in complex amplification patterns in Taipei City, with an overall PGV increase of more than 50$\%$. For realistic subduction zone earthquake scenarios off the northeast coast of Taiwan, the effects of topography on ground motion in both the mountains and the Taipei basin vary and depend on the rupture process. The complex interactions that can occur between mountains and surrounding areas, especially sedimentary basins, illustrate the fact that topography should be taken into account when assessing seismic hazard.},

abstract ={We combine light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital terrain model (DTM) data and an improved mesh implementation to investigate the effects of high-resolution surface topography on seismic ground motion based upon the spectral-element method. In general, topography increases the amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys usually have reduced ground motion, as has been observed in both records from past earthquakes and numerical simulations. However, the effects of realistic topography on ground motion have not often been clearly characterized in numerical simulations, especially the seismic response of the true ground surface. Here, we use LiDAR DTM data, which provide two-meter resolution at the free surface, and a spectral-element method to simulate three-dimensional (3D) seismic-wave propagation in the Yangminshan region in Taiwan, incorporating the effects of realistic topography. A smoothed topographic map is employed beneath the model surface in order to decrease mesh distortions due to steep ground surfaces. Numerical simulations show that seismic shaking in mountainous areas is strongly affected by topography and source frequency content. The amplification of ground motion mainly occurs at the tops of hills and ridges whilst the valleys and flat-topped hills experience lower levels of ground shaking. Interaction between small-scale topographic features and high-frequency surface waves can produce unusually strong shaking. We demonstrate that topographic variations can change peak ground acceleration (PGA) values by ±50% in mountainous areas, and the relative change in PGA between a valley and a ridge can be as high as a factor of 2 compared to a flat surface response. This suggests that high-resolution, realistic topographic features should be taken into account in seismic hazard analysis, especially for densely populated mountainous areas.},

By simulating a Mw 7.5 earthquake on the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault, we show that the San Gabriel Mountains act as a natural seismic insulator for metropolitan Los Angeles. The topography of the mountains scatters the surface waves generated by the rupture on the San Andreas fault, leading to less-efficient excitation of basin-edge generated waves and natural resonances within the Los Angeles Basin. The effect of the mountains reduces the peak amplitude of ground velocity for some regions in the basin by as much as 50% in the frequency band up to 0.5 Hz. These results suggest that, depending on the relative location of faulting and the nearby large-scale topography, the topography can shield some areas from ground shaking.},

The earthquake left some important lessons that must be taken into account for the management of similar situations in the future. With respect to the behavior of buildings, the soundness and importance of the code of practice for buildings was demonstrated as a tool for the prevention of seismic disasters. The management of the emergency in cities such as Pereira and Armenia showed the need for planning, continued preparedness and mitigation awareness. The importance of the Colombian Prevention and Disaster Attention System (SNPAD) was demonstrated although the need to enhance organizational aspects, citizen awareness and participation was made evident. The characteristics of the disaster reflect a typical situation that can occur in many Latin American cities located in areas of high seismic risk. This article presents the main lessons learned from this event in the light of work performed by the research team for natural disasters from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the Universidad de Los Andes.},

An exact analytical determination of unknown coefficients is carried out by insuring the vanishing of normal stresses on crack faces. Frequency-domain results are given for extremely near, near, and far fields, whereas time-domain ones are for horizontal surface and subsurface motions. Comparisons with published data for the dynamic stress intensity factor show good agreement. The exact analytical nature of proposed solutions can be applied very conveniently and rapidly to high-frequency steady-state cases, enhancing the computation efficiency in transient cases when performing the fast Fourier transform.

Appropriate wavefunctions and Graf's addition formulas are well utilized. The introduction of the method of images fulfills the stress-free condition at the ground level. In the deep V-shaped cases, comparisons with previously published data show good agreement. In the degenerate cases where the width of the canyon approaches zero, the presented results coincide with those obtained from the exact series solution of a single zero-thickness vertical edge crack. Both frequency- and time-domain results are given. Effects of the parameters on steady-state surface motions are illustrated and discussed. Transient changes in surface and subsurface displacement fields are included.

With the aid of the coordinate-transformed relation, which is intended as a substitute for the addition theorem (involving multiple summations of Mathieu functions), the application of the RPMT facilitates the rapid construction of simultaneous equations. Enforcement of zero-stress conditions on the curved valley surface and continuity conditions on the soil-bedrock interface leads to the determination of unknown coefficients. Comparisons with published data for several limiting cases (e.g. those pertaining to the truncated semi-circular canyon, the partially filled semi-circular alluvial valley, the totally empty semi-elliptic canyon and the fully filled semi-elliptic alluvial valley) show good agreement. Effects of pertinent parameters on steady-state surface motions are demonstrated. Transient changes in surface displacement amplitude are also included.},

abstract ={The scattering of plane SH waves incident on a circular sectorial canyon is considered. An accurate region-matching technique is applied to derive a rigorous series solution. Appropriate wavefunctions are employed to describe antiplane motions. Judicious basis functions, involving Gegenbauer polynomials, are well utilized to correctly capture the singular behaviour in stress fields near the canyon bottom. The enforcement of matching conditions on the auxiliary boundary leads to the determination of unknown coefficients. Plotted results demonstrate the influence of pertinent parameters on surface and subsurface motions. Both steady-state and transient results are included. The solution technique proposed achieves a considerable reduction in the computational effort, facilitating benchmark computations. The derived series solution enriches the limited list of series solutions presently known for canyon problems related to SH-wave scattering.},

abstract ={The series solution of wave functions for 2D scattering and diffraction of plane SH (shear horizontal) waves induced by a U‐shaped canyon is proposed herein to account for the topographic effect of such a canyon. The wave function expansion method has been frequently employed to study the topographic effect because it can reveal the physics of the wave scattering and can test the accuracy of other methods. Through a new domain decomposition strategy, the half‐space having a U‐shaped canyon is divided into three subregions. Hence, we defined three cylindrical coordinate systems. In each coordinate system, the wave field satisfying the Helmholtz equation was represented by means of the separation of variables method, in terms of the series of both Bessel functions and Hankel functions with unknown complex coefficients. Then three wave fields are all represented in the same coordinate system using the Graf addition theorem. The unknown coefficients are solved by satisfying the continuity conditions of the auxiliary boundary and the traction‐free boundary conditions on the bottom of the canyon. To show the effects of symmetrical and nonsymmetrical U‐shaped canyons on the surface ground motion, a parametric analysis is carried out in the frequency domain. Surface and subsurface transient responses in the time domain demonstrate the phenomenon of wave propagating and scattering. It is found that a zone of amplification can obviously take place at the bottom of a U‐shaped canyon with nearly vertical walls.},

abstract = {Topographies have significant effects on seismic waves. The wavefunction expansion method has been frequently employed to study the topographic effect because this method can reveal the physics of the wave scattering and can testify the accuracy of numerical methods. The 2-D scattering and diffraction of plane SH waves induced by a non-symmetrical V-shaped canyon is examined here by using the wavefunction expansion method. Through a new domain decomposition strategy, the half-space containing a V-shaped canyon is divided into three subregions. Then the wavefield for every subregion is constructed in terms of an infinite series of wavefunctions with unknown coefficients in three coordinate systems, respectively. After that, three wavefields are all represented in the same coordinate system using the Graf addition theorem. The unknown coefficients are obtained by satisfying the continuity conditions of the auxiliary boundary. The proposed series solution of wavefunctions for a non-symmetrical V-shaped canyon can be reduced to a symmetrical case. Results in this study for the symmetrical case agree very well with those in the published literature. To show the effects of the non-symmetrical-geometry topography on the surface ground motion, a parametric study is carried out in the frequency domain. Surface and subsurface transient responses in the time domain demonstrate the phenomenon of wave propagating and scattering. Finally, the proposed model is successfully applied to two idealized cross sections of Pacoima canyon and Feitsui canyon.},

abstract="This paper reports a series solution of wave functions for two-dimensional scattering and diffraction of plane SH waves induced by a symmetrical V-shaped canyon with different shape ratios. A half-space with a symmetrical V-shaped canyon is divided into two sub-regions by using a circular-arc auxiliary boundary. The two sub-regions are represented by global and local cylindrical coordinate systems, respectively. In each coordinate system, the wave field satisfying the Helmholtz equation is represented by the separation of variables method, in terms of the series of both Bessel functions and Hankel functions with unknown complex coefficients. Then, the two wave fields are described in the local coordinate system using the Graf addition theorem. Finally, the unknown coefficients are sought by satisfying the continuity conditions of the auxiliary boundary. To consider the phase characteristics of the wave scattering, a parametric analysis is carried out in the time domain by assuming an incident signal of the Ricker type. Surface and subsurface transient responses demonstrate the characteristics and mechanisms of wave propagating and scattering."
